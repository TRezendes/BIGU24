# Sink or Swim, Exploring the Uncharted Territories of AI-Drive Attacks and Defenses


- Rise in more sophisticated email phishing attacks
  -
- Deep fake video attacks
- Deep fake audio attacks likely coming
- Polymorphic malware
- Speed of change in threats

## What are the most common AI attacks

- Phishing emails now much more sophisticated thanks to NLP

## What indicators are there that AI is being used in a cyber attack and how do you fight it?

- Use AI to combat AI
- People, Process, *and* Technology
  - If it was tech only, we would have solved it by now

## What are Strategic Implications for Companies in the Near Future?

- Intentional focus on education


## Walk us Through a Recent Cyber Attack That Utilized AI

## What are the Challenges of Combatting AI Cybersecurity Threats Compared to Traditional Threats?

- AI increases the speed and ease of malware techniques. You no longer need to be a software developer to be a bad guy.

## What Lessons Can We Learn From These Incidents?

- The entire organization is part of the solution
- If the tools you are using do not incorporate ML, NLP, etc. it will be harder/impossible to detect AI threats

## What are Some of the Latest Advancements in AI Technologies  THat are being Used for Defense?

- AI/ML baked into basically all new cybersecurity defense tools now
- Mail filters now incorporate AI/ML

## How are AI Cybersecurity Platforms Changing Threat Response?

- Improving detection
- Reducing time to detect
  - Able to lockdown compromises so quickly that the threat actor does not have time to cause damage
- Must understand and monitor AI algorithms

## Realworld Examples?

- Seeing companies getting protected on a daily basis based on AI powered tools
- EDR, SIEM, E-Mail Filters all now have AI built in
- AI powered SIEM processing logs automatically and locked out penetration by actor from UAE within five minutes.

## What Risks/Challenges Should Executives Be Aware of in Investing in AI Tools

- Make sure you're not leaking data
- Don't over-rely on AI, as it can expose an organization to litigation
  - Copyright claims
  - Hallucinated answers
- Understand the tools you are using
  - The good guys have to get it right every time, the bad guys only have to get it right once

## Future Trends and Predictions

- Audiojacking
  - MitM audio deepfake: changing a phone conversation in-transit
- Poisoning of LLMs

## How do You Think AI and Cybersecurity will Evolve in terms of Defensive Technologies

- Increase in automation
- Strength Multiplier
  - Use it like a calculator. We all know what 2+2 is, but sometimes you need to move faster, so you use a tool
- Self-healing systems
  - Automatically isolate threat

## Predictions for Next Five Years

- Refined LLMs
- Continued integration into tools
- Darkweb GPTs (already available)

## How can the Cybersecurity Industry Stay Ahead of Threats?

- Emphasis on continuing education
  - Continuous learning. Always keep up with the latest
- Incident response workshops within organization


## What are You Most Excited For/Worried About in the Future

- Excited
  - AI Automations
  - Hyperautomation
  - Tools that can be tailored to your specific organization
  - AI as an assistant, not only in IT
- Worried
  - Over reliance
